# Create LangGraph version of basic_g.py (2025-07-04 14:39Z)

_**User**_

can you create a _g version ( langgraph version) of basic_g.py for me? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a LangGraph version of the basic prompt engineering lesson. Let me first examine the current file to understand its structure and then create the LangGraph equivalent.


---

Read file: src/lesson02_Prompt_Engineering/lesson02010_basic.py

---

Now I'll create a LangGraph version of this basic prompt engineering lesson. The LangGraph version will demonstrate the same prompt engineering concepts but using a graph-based approach.
